      Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often
      differ from one language to another. This article attempts to list the
      built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they

      loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not
      directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can
      be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

  )
}
